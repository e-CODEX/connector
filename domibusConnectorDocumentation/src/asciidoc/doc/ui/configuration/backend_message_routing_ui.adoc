= Backend Message Routing View

This view allows configuring how messages are routed to which of the available destinations ("backends").

== Backend Routing Table

Every row in the table shows a routing configuration.

image:screenshot_routing_table.png[]

The "Configuration Source" can have values (IMPL, ENV or DB), which describes where the rule configuration originates from.

|===
|Value |Description |Editable |Deletable

|IMP
|This rule was configured automatically as a default for e.g. connector-to-connector tests.
|false
|false

|ENV
|The rule is in the configuration file.
|false
|false

|DB
|The rule is in the database.
|true
|true

|===

The "Link Name" column contains the name of the backend to which a message is routed if is matched by the clause.

The "Match Clause" column contains the rule by which messages are selected for routing. Only matching messages are routed.

The "Priority" column contains an integer value. Higher numbers take precedence over lower numbers e.g. 0 is of higher priority than -2000. If there would be more than one match, only the match of higher priority is executed and the message is only forwarded to that backend.

IMPORTANT: If you want to override an ENV rule you can add a rule with the same match clause and backend, but with a higher priority.

The last column contains two buttons.

* Edit rule (wrench symbol)
* Delete rule (trash can symbol)

_Note: These buttons only show for rules that are stored in the database (DB)._

WARNING: Both Actions take immediate effect.

== Create new routing rule

In order to create new rules, first click the button "Create new routing rule". In the dialog specify the match clause that enables filtering which messages to route and the backend to which the message should be routed. If you plan to use multiple rules, then there might be multiple matches. In this case you can use a priority to give precedence to the rules (see above).

== Route Expressions


=== Token

Each route expression consists of Token. Token are separated using a "," colon sign.

A Token is build using a comparator expression and condition.

The comparator could either be "startsWith", if the condition only needs to be fulfilled as first part of the value,
or "equals". In that case the whole value needs to match the condition.

A token is always build in the form

[source]
----
comparisonType(contentType,value)
----

==== Comparison Types

There are currently two comparison types supported:

* startsWith: The values compared need to have the same beginning.
* equals: The values compared must be identical.
* not: The values compared must not match.

==== Content Types

This is the first part inside the brackets of a Token.
The content type defines what is actually compared.

The currently supported content types are:

* ServiceName: The name of the AS4 Service of which the message is.
* ServiceType: The type of the AS4 Service of which the message is.
* Action: The AS4 Action of which the message is.
* FromPartyId: The PartyId of the AS4 From Party. This is the sender gateway identification.
* FromPartyIdType: The PartyIdType of the AS4 From Party.
* FromPartyIdRole: The Role of the AS4 From Party.
* FinalRecipient: The finalRecipient defined in the ebms header of the message.

Most of the content types rely to the PMode-Set data. So the values can be taken from there.

==== Values

Values are strings that are compared. The are delimited by "*'*" symbols.

Example:
'someValue'

The value could either be a simple expression identifying the actual content.

But the value could also be a regular expression.

==== Examples

.Examples for Token
|===
|token|definition|matching|not matching

|startsWith(FromPartyIdType,'urn:oasis:names:tc:ebcore:partyid-type:iso')
|This Token defines that the FromParty of the message, more detailed the PartyIdType of the FromParty is compared to 'urn:oasis:names:tc:ebcore:partyid-type:iso'.
If the PartyIdType starts with that value, then it is a match.
|FromParty:
PartyId = AT
PartyIdType = urn:oasis:names:tc:ebcore:partyid-type:iso3166-1
|FromParty:
PartyId = AT
PartyIdType = urn:oasis:names:tc:ebcore:partyid-type:unregistered

|equals(FinalRecipient,'CourtABC')
|This token defines that the finalRecipient of the message must be the value of the token.
|'finalRecipient=CourtABC'
|'finalRecipient=CourtABZ'

|not(ServiceName,'EPO')
|This token excludes messages of AS4 service 'EPO'.
|Service:
ServiceName='Mla'
ServiceType='urn:e-codex:services:'
|Service:
ServiceName='EPO'
ServiceType='urn:e-codex:services:'

|===

=== Combining Token

Token can be combined hierarchically to form a route expression.

In case of a combination of token with a condition, the token need to be within brackets after the condition, separated by a colon:

[source]
----
condition(token1,token2)
----

==== Conditions

To combine token, a combination condition needs to be set first.

Supported conditions are:

* AND: inclusive combination used with a "*&*" symbol. Both token need to match to fulfill the rule.
* OR: combination used with a "*|*" symbol. Either one of the token combined need to match to fulfill the rule.

IMPORTANT: Instead of combining token with an OR condition it is also possible to define more rules. This leads to simpler route expressions and is easier to maintain.

==== Examples

.Examples of combinations of token
|===
|route expression|explaination|matching message content | not matching message content

|&(equals(ServiceName,'Mla'),startsWith(FinalRecipient,'Court'))
|his route expression matches to all messages of AS4 Service 'EPO' which finalRecipient starts with 'Court'.
|Service='Mla' and finalRecipient='CourtABC'
|Service='Mla' and finalRecipient='ProsecutionOffice123'

|\|(equals(ServiceName,'Mla'),equals(ServiceName,'Eio'))
|This route expression matches to all messages of AS4 Service 'Mla' OR 'Eio'.
|Service='Mla'
|Service='EPO'

|&(\|(equals(ServiceName,'Mla'),equals(ServiceName,'Eio')),startsWith(FinalRecipient,'ProsecutionOffice'))
|This is a combination with a combination within.
It says that a message must be of AS4 Service 'Mla' OR 'Eio', but to a finalRecipient that starts with 'ProsecutionOffice'.
|Service='Mla' and finalRecipient='ProsecutionOffice123'.
Service='Eio' and finalRecipient='ProsecutionOffice456'.
|Service='Eio' and finalRecipient='CourtABC'.
Service='Mla' and finalRecipient='ProsecutionOffice456'.
Service='EPO' and finalRecipient='ProsecutionOffice123'.

=== Syntax definition

The route expressions are built using a DSL similar to REGEX.

Syntax definition:

[source]
----
<ROUTING_RULE_PATTERN> ::= <BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION> | <COMPARE_EXPRESSION> | <NOT_EXPRESSION>
<BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION> ::= <OPERAND>(<ROUTING_RULE_PATTERN>, <ROUTING_RULE_PATTERN>)
<COMPARE_EXPRESSION> ::= equals(<AS4_TYPE>, '<VALUE>') | startswith(<AS4_TYPE>, '<VALUE>')
<NOT_EXPRESSION> ::= not(<ROUTING_RULE_PATTERN>)
<OPERAND> ::= "&" | "|"
<AS4_TYPE> ::= ServiceType | ServiceName | FinalRecipient | Action | FromPartyId | FromPartyRole | FromPartyIdType
<VALUE> ::= <VALUE><LETTER> | <LETTER>
<LETTER> can be every letter [a-z][A-Z][0-9] other printable characters might work, but they untested! ['\|&)( will definitiv not work!]
