= Upgrade to 4.2.0

== Upgrade Manual

=== Configuration Properties

There has been the following changes within the configuration properties:

* token.issuer.service.provider => renamed to => token.issuer.service-provider
* token.issuer.aes.value => renamed to => token.issuer.advanced-electronic-system-type
* identity.provider => renamed to => token.issuer.identity-provider
* postal.address.postal.code => renamed to => postal.address.zip-code

Also check the automatically generated properties report: link:../aggregated-spring-properties.html[Connector Properties]

=== Database

There has also been multiple changes to the database regarding the support for loopback message sending
and first work on full support on multi usecase handling. For the database changes migration scripts are
provided within the documentation folder.

* dbscripts/migrate/oracle_migrate_4.1.x_to_4.2.0.sql
* dbscripts/migrate/mysql_migrate_4.1.x_to_4.2.0.sql


NOTE: For everyone who has used spring.liquibase.enabled=true during initial connector setup,
the connector will apply the database schema changes automatically on first startup! So in this case
do not use the provided migration scripts to avoid conflicts!


==== Database changes overview:

* The message table now contains a message source and a message target instead of a message direction
The source and target could be GATEWAY, BACKEND, CONNECTOR
* The EBMS id is now unique per target, so the connector can now fully support a loop backed message
also the evidences get correctly assigned to the specific message
* Additionally to the backend name of a message also a gateway name has been added to support multiple
backends or the domibus gateway within multi tenancy mode. This feature is not complete yet!
* A tracking table for message transport to backend or connector has been added, for the future
messages delivered to a pull backend will be stored within the database instead a message queue,
to prevent a queue overflow.
* Quartz tables have been added

=== Quartz
The connector uses timer jobs for multiple jobs. Quartz is similar to cron. Quartz can also run in a clustered
environment. For this purpose quartz uses database locks to ensure that jobs are not running at the same time.

For operating within clustered mode which is currently considered experimental set the following property:

* spring.quartz.properties.org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered=true

Also make sure that the same database, JMS-Server and FileSystem is accessed!
