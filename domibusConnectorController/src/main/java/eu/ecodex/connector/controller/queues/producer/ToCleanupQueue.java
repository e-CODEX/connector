/**
 * The ToCleanupQueue class is a subclass of ManageableQueue.
 * It represents a queue used for cleanup operations.
 *
 * <p>The ToCleanupQueue class extends ManageableQueue and inherits its methods for managing queues
 * and dead letter queues (DLQs).
 *
 * <p>This class is a Spring component, indicating that it can be managed by the Spring framework.
 *
 * <p>This class has a constructor that accepts a destination queue, a dead letter queue (DLQ),
 * and a JmsTemplate.
 * These dependencies are passed to the superclass constructor, which is defined in
 * the ManageableQueue class.
 *
 * <p>This class does not provide any additional methods or functionality beyond what is inherited
 * from the ManageableQueue class.
 * Its purpose is to provide a specific implementation of the ManageableQueue class for cleanup
 * operations.
 *
 * <p>Usage:
 * ToCleanupQueue qcq = new ToCleanupQueue(destination, dlq, jmsTemplate);
