/**
 * The InvalidConfig_SigBasedNationalTechValidator class provides static methods to obtain instances
 * of ECodexTechnicalValidationService with different types of invalid configurations. These invalid
 * configurations are used for testing purposes. The class contains three variants of the
 * get_SigBasedNationalTechValidator method, each returning an instance of the
 * National_Signature_TechnicalValidationService class with a different invalid configuration.
 *
 * <p>The ECodexTechnicalValidationService interface is a contract for creating the technical
 * validation (result and report) on the business document. The ECodexTechnicalValidationService
 * object is called as a delegate by the DSS implementation of the ECodexContainerService interface.
 * Implementors of the ECodexTechnicalValidationService interface must guarantee that the object
 * instances provided in parameters do not become tampered or changed. The execution of the methods
 * in the interface must be thread-safe. All the methods in the interface may throw an
 * ECodexException.
