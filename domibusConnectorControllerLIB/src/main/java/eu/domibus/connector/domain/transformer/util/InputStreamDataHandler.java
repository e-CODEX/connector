 * The InputStreamDataHandler class is a subclass of the DataHandler class. It provides a way to

 * to it.
 *
 * <p>The constructor of this class takes a DataSource object as a parameter. The DataSource object
 * represents the source of the data, which can be an input stream. The InputStreamDataHandler class
 * then uses this source to read and handle the data.
