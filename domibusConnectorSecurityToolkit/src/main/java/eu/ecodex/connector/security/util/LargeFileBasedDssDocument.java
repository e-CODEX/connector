/**
 * This class represents a DSS (Document Storage System) document that is based on large files. It
 * extends the CommonDocument class and implements the DSSDocument interface.
 *
 * <p>The LargeFileBasedDssDocument class encapsulates a large file persistence service and a large
 * file reference. It provides methods to open an input stream to read the contents of the document,
 * get the MIME type of the document, and get the name of the document.
 *
 * <p>The large file persistence service is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of
 * large files. It provides methods to create and delete large file references, and retrieve a
 * readable data source for a given reference.
 *
 * <p>The large file reference represents a reference to a storage system for big files. It
 * contains
 * information such as the storage provider name, storage ID reference, name, MIME type, size, and
 * creation date of the file. The LargeFileReference class also implements the DataSource interface,
 * providing methods to get the input and output streams for the file.
 *
 * <p>The LargeFileBasedDssDocument class uses the large file persistence service to retrieve a
 * readable data source for the large file reference. It then uses the readable data source to open
 * an input stream to read the contents of the document. The MIME type and name of the document are
 * retrieved from the large file reference.
