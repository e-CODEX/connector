= Connector Link Plugins Manual


Since 4.3.0 the connector comes with different link plugins.

This document describes how this links are configured with properties. The UI configuration manual is link:../ui/linkconfig/link_configuration.html[here] aviailable.

The general architecture of the link is link:../architecture/link_partners.html[here] available.

== The available plugins

* WS Gateway Push Plugins
* WS Gateway Pull Plugin
* WS Backend Plugin


=== Configuration Model

The Links are known to the connectorController only by
DomibusConnectorLinkPartner. Only the LinkPartner name is stored
to the message processing. So how/who the LinkPartner is is completly
transparent to the message processing flow.

The configuration itself is read into the DomibusConnectorLink and
DomibusConnectorLinkPartner classes. Afterwards when the LinkPartner and Link is
activated during startup the ActiveLinkConfiguration and ActiveLInkPartner
is created.

==== Configuration Sources

The configuration can be read from the environment (spring properties). This configuration cannot be changed via the UI. It is also supported to
load the configuration from the DB. This configuration can be changed via the UI.

===== The link-partner-name

For every link partner a link-partner-name must be stated. This name
has to be **unique** over all configuration sources. This name is used
to address the link partner. It is also used within the backend routing.

CAUTION: The backends are authenticated with certificates at the connector. The CN of the certificate is used to determine which backend is talking to the connector. So make sure every backend has it's own CN within its certificate.

=== Configuration via Property File

Or configuration via the environment. With this approach the configured
link partners are read from the spring environment. The spring environment
is usually constructed from the connector.properties file.

==== Setting up example for Gateway Pull Link:

The gateway link is configured under the properties prefix 'connector.link.gateway'

Currently only one gateway is supported. The name of the used gateway has
to entered within the link-partner-name property and has to be: **default_gateway**

==== Setting up example for backend Ws Link:

The backend link(s) are configured under the properties prefix 'connector.link.backend[0-99]'.
On the backend side the connector supports multiple backends and backend partners.

CAUTION: The different backends are addressed by the backend routing. For backend routing
the link-partner-name property is used! This property also has to be **unique**!
