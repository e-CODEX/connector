/**
 * ValidConfig_SigBasedNationalTechValidator is a class that provides a method to obtain an instance
 * of {@link ECodexTechnicalValidationService} with a specific configuration for signature-based
 * national technical validation.
 *
 * <p>he class contains a static method {@code get_SigBasedNationalTechValidator} that returns an
 * instance of {@link National_Signature_TechnicalValidationService}. This method ensures that all
 * required data is present and properly configured for the technical validation of a national
 * signature.
 *
 * <p>The returned service object implements the {@link ECodexTechnicalValidationService}
 * interface, which defines methods for creating the technical validation and generating a
 * validation report in PDF format.
 *
 * <p>The use of this class is recommended when performing signature-based national technical
 * validation. However, it is important to provide the necessary data before using the returned
 * service object.
 *
 * <p>Note: This class does not provide documentation for its type member properties.
