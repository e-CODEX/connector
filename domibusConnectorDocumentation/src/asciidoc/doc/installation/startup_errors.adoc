= STARTUP ERRORS


The connector is build with the spring boot framework. During startup
the framework initializes property classes from Property
(see this list: link:../aggregated-spring-properties.html[Property List]).
The properties are also checked during startup so it might happen, that you
are going to see the following error:

```
***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

Binding to target org.springframework.boot.context.properties.bind.BindException: Failed to bind properties under 'token.issuer' to eu.domibus.connector.security.container.service.TokenIssuerFactoryProperties failed:

    Property: token.issuer.advancedElectronicSystemType
    Value: null
    Reason: must not be null


Action:

Update your application's configuration
```

This error means that you should check the content of the following property:

token.issuer.advancedElectronicSystemType

NOTE: The property
**token.issuer.advancedElectronicSystemType**
is equevalent to
**token.issuer.advanced-electronic-system-type**
