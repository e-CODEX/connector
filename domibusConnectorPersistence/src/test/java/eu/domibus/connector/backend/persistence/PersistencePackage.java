/**
 * The PersistencePackage interface represents a package that contains data related to persistence.
 * It serves as a marker interface for classes that are involved in persistence operations.
 *
 * <p>Implementing classes should provide the necessary functionality to perform persistence
 * operations such as saving and retrieving data from a persistence store (e.g., a database, file
 * system, etc.).
 *
 * <p>This interface does not define any specific methods as it is meant to be a base interface for
 * different persistence package implementations.
 *
 * <p>Classes that implement this interface should provide detailed documentation about their
 * specific functionality and usage.
