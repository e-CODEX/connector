= Certificate Configurations

The connector uses multiple certificates for different purposes.

* Signing and Encrypting SOAP messages between BackendClient and Connector
* Establishing Transport Security (TLS) between Connector and BackendClient
* Singing and Encrypting SOAP messages between Connector and Gateway
* Establishing Transport Security (TLS) between Connector and Gateway
* Validating the signature of the asic-s container
* Signing the asic-s container
* Signing the evidences
* (Validating the evidences) which is not done yet

For each of this use cases you have to use at least one private-public key pair. As an example at
the backend connection you have to generate for each client a private-public key pair.

== Connector Backend Key Store

The connector backend key store holds the private key of the connector which is used to decrypt and sign
the messages which are sent to the connector clients.
It also contains all public keys of the connectorClients to verify the signed messages. The common name of
the certificate is also used to identify the connectorClient name.

The configuration properties are:

----
#defines the location of the backend keyStore:
connector.backend.ws.key.store.path=
#defines the key store password:    
connector.backend.ws.key.store.password=
#defines the key alias for the key which is used to sign the messages:
connector.backend.ws.key.key.alias=
#defines the key password:
connector.backend.ws.key.key.password=
----

== Evidence Builder Key Store (Connector Key Store)

The evidence builder key store holds the private key for signing the generated evidences.
This private key and key store can be the same for signing the ASIC-S container.

The configuration properties are:

----
#defines the key store location:
connector.evidences.keystore.path=
#defines the keystore password
connector.evidences.keystore.password=
#defines the key alias
connector.evidences.key.alias=
#defines the key password
connector.evidences.key.password=
----

== Security Lib Key Store (Connector Key Store)

The security lib key store holds the private key for signing the ASIC-S container.
The private key and key store can be the same as the for signing the evidences.

----
#defines the key store location:
connector.security.keystore.path=
#defines the key store password
connector.security.keystore.password=
#defines the key alias
connector.security.key.alias=
#defines the key password
connector.security.key.password=
----

== Security Lib Trust Store (Connector Trust Store)

The security lib trust store also known as connector trust store contains the public certificates of
the partner countries to verify the ASIC-S container signature.
It also contains the national certificates if SIGNATURE_BASED Authentication is used.
Because the security lib is using the certificates from this store to verify the signature of the national
documents.

----
#defines the key store location:
connector.security.ojstore.path=
#defines the store password
connector.security.ojstore.password=
----

== TLS Key Store (System Key Store)

The TLS Key Store is used to establish a trust if the connector has to make a TLS/SSL encrypted
connection to the GW(plugin) or connectorClient. For this purpose the connector uses
the system key store which is provided by java itself.
