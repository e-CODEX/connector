= Upgrade Manual

Here you can find a description of the steps that have to be made when upgrading an existing installation of domibusConnector.

== Principles

Upgrades, in principle, do contain of the following steps:

* Migration the database of the domibusConnector
* Upgrading the configuration
* Upgrading the binary. Can be WAR file in case of deployable, or the JAR in bin of the standalone application.

IMPORTANT: We strictly recommend to create a backup of all the parts to be upgraded before doing the actual upgrade. Especially for database migration!
