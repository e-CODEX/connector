= Architectural Overview

This document gives a brief overview.

== Overall e-CODEX technical infrastructure

The overall e-CODEX technical architecture foresees that an e-CODEX access point consists of installed and configured building blocks.
Communication over e-CODEX in principle works via connected gateways. The e-CODEX interpretation of messages is done by the domibusConnector.
In the end, every e-CODEX partner participating in one or more business use-cases requires a use-case specific software to handle the business
side of the use-case. This can either be a generic domibusConnectorClient, a reference implementation for the use-case, or a specific software product implemented
for that particular use-case at the e-CODEX partner.

== e-CODEX building blocks

The domibusConnector is only one building block in the e-CODEX technical infrastructure.
An overview of the e-CODEX building blocks can be found on the link:https://www.e-codex.eu/tech[e-CODEX website].

How most of the e-CODEX building blocks interact is shown in this picture:

== domibusConnector and supporting products

The main features of the domibusConnector, the domibusConnectorClient and the domibus-connector-plugin
is also on the e-CODEX website link:https://www.e-codex.eu/node/47[here].
