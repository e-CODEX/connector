= ECodex Container Configuration

The eCodexContainer (ASIC-S container) is built by the domibusConnector. The built container will then be signed with an electronic signature.

Any received eCodexContainer is verified by the domibusConnector. This means that the electronic signature attached to the container is validated.

== Import old config

This button gives the opportunity to import from your old configuration used for domibusConnector-4.2.x and domibusConnector-4.3.x.

It opens a dialog where the old configuration file (usually "connector.properties") can be uploaded.

After successful upload of the old configuration file, a read-only dialog is shown with the properties imported from the old config.

When the Button "Save Imported Config" is hit, a new Dialog shows the actual properties that get imported into the domibusConnector database. Their database target is the table DC_MESSAGE_LANE_PROPERTY.

This dialog has to be confirmed by hitting the "Check" Button.

Once approved, the imported configuration takes immediate effect.

The whole process can be interrupted any time by closing the dialog or by "Cancel" Button.

== Save/Reset Changes

The Configuration edited within this mask can be reset at any time hitting the "Reset Changes" Button.
This causes the configuration being reloaded and the mask being refreshed with the loaded configuration.

"Save Changes" causes the configuration to be stored into the domibusConnector database. Their database target is the table DC_MESSAGE_LANE_PROPERTY.

Once approved, the saved configuration takes immediate effect.

.eCodexContainer Signature Validation Configuration Properties
|===
| property | description | field type | example values

| Location of EtsiValidationPolicyXml
| The Location of the Etsi Validation Policy. This policy is used by the DSS Utils to verify the certificate of the attched signature on the business document.
| TextField
| by default a classpath reference.

| Use Trust Store
| Use an own TrustStore Configuration for verification.
| Readonly-Checkbox
a| * set (true): the following properties deifine the TrustStore used for verification.
* not set (false): the trustStore imported with the PMode-Set will be used for verification. 

| Trust Store Configuration
| Configuration of the TrustStore used for verification. This Store should contain the public keys of certificates used for electronic signatures on business documents.
| Multiple fields readonly
| By default the trustStore imported with the PMode-Set.

| Use Ignore Store
| Use the Ignore Store, any certificate in here would be considered not trusted.
| Checkbox
a| * set (true): the following properties deifine the TrustStore with certificates ignored.
* not set (false): no TrustStore used with certificates ignored. 

| Ignore Store Configuration
| Configuration of the TrustStore containing certificates to be ignored (not trusted).
| Multiple fields
| Default TrustStore configuration fields.

| Set the trusted list source
| Any configured trusted list source can be set here as trust source. The certificates provided by this source will be considered as trusted.
| TextField
| Any value

| Should OCSP be used on certificate verification
| For this the checked certificate must provide a OCSP source address and the connector itself must be able to reach the OCSP source.
| Checkbox
a| * set (true)
* not set (false)

| Should CRL be used on certificate verification
| For this the checked certificate must provide a CRL URL and the connector itself must be able to reach the provided CRL URL.
| Checkbox
a| * set (true)
* not set (false)

| Should AIA Source be enabled on certificate verification
| The AIA source is used to collect certificates from external resources (AIA). For more details see link:https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/DSS/webapp-demo/doc/dss-documentation.html#certificateVerifier[DSS certificateVerifier].
If set to false a IgnoreSource will be used for AIA resolving. So no query at all is made.
| Checkbox
a| * set (true)
* not set (false)

.eCodexContainer Signature Configuration Properties
|===
| property | description | field type | example values

| Encryption Algorithm
| Which Encryption Algorithm should be used for signatures.
| Single-Select-Box
| Any supported algorithm.

| Digest Algorithm
| Which Digest Algorithm should be used for digests during signature creation.
| Single-Select-Box
| Any supported algorithm.

| Key Store Configuration
| The configuration of the keyStore holding the private key for signing.
| Multiple fields
| Path or database reference of the keyStore, its password and type.

| Private Key Configuration
| Private key configuration with key alias (must exist within the keystore) and a key password to open the private key. This key is used to sign the ASIC-S container, TrustTokenPDF, TrustTokenXML. The public key of this keypair must be shared with your communication partners.
| Multiple fields
| The alias and the password.
