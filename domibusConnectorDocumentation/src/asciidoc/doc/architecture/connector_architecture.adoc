= domibusConnector architecture

This page describes the architectural principles the domibusConnector is build upon.

== Modules

The domibusConnector is built as a Maven multi-module project.
All the modules are connected via dependencies.

== Decoupled asynchronous workflow

The processing of the domibusConnector works that way, that all external communication is
decoupled from the processing modules.

That means that between the module responsible for communication, the domibusConnectorLink,
only exchanges messages with the domibusConnectorController over API. Between those components are 
JMS message queues. 
Messages arriving at the 

=== domibusConnectorLinkCommon

The LinkModule is responsible for:

* Receiving messages from LinkPartners
* Transforming this messages to the domain model
* Initial Storage of the message
* Handing message over to ConnectorController

=== domibusConnectorController

Is responsible for

* Message Evidence/Flow
* Evidence Generation via EvidenceToolkit
* Extraction/Generation of ASIC-S container via SecurityToolkit
* XML/PDF-Token generation via SecurityToolkit
* Assigning Message to correct backend
* Timer Jobs for Evidences

Is not responsible for:

* Connection to Link Partners

==== Interface between connector and link module

The connector and the link module are sharing the following interfaces:

* SubmitToConnector - for handing over the message to the connectorController
* SubmitToLink - for handing over the message to LinkModule
* MessagePersistenceService - for loading/storing messages from/to Storage
* TransportStateService - to mark the current transport state of the message

=== domibusConnectorControllerAPI

* Holds all interfaces for the connector modules to communicate with each other
