= domibusConnectorAPI

The domibusConnectorAPI module defines via *WSDL webservice definitions* the external interfaces for communicating with the domibusConnector.

It also contains an *XSD schema* defining the contents transported via the webservices. This is the *transition model* of the domibusConnector.

The WSDL and XSD definitions are generated into *JAVA stubs* for better implementation convenience.

== Webservice Interfaces

.Webservice Interface Description
|===
| Name | Description | since version

| <<DomibusConnectorBackendWebService,DomibusConnectorBackendWebService>>
| Is provided by the connector and is meant for the clients/connector backends to to retrieve and push messages.
| 4.0

| <<DomibusConnectorBackendDeliveryWebService,DomibusConnectorBackendDeliveryWebService>>
| Must be provided by the client/backend. If push is enabled then the connector will push messages
to this web interface.
| 4.0

| <<DomibusConnectorGatewayDeliveryWebService,DomibusConnectorGatewayDeliveryWebService>>
| Is provided by the connector so the gateway can push messages to the connector.
| 4.0

| <<DomibusConnectorGatewaySubmissionWebService,DomibusConnectorGatewaySubmissionWebService>>
| Must be provided by the AS4 Gateway (for domibus this is provided by the domibus-connector-plugin).
| 4.0

| <<DomibusConnectorGatewayWebService,DomibusConnectorGatewayWebService>>
| Is provided by the AS4 Gateway (for domibus this is provided by the domibus-connector-plugin). This interface is an alternative to the interfaces DomibusConnectorGatewayDeliveryWebService and 
DomibusConnectorGatewaySubmissionWebService. If a connector to gateway connection should only be single direction (from the connector to the gateway),
this interface can be used.
| 4.3

|===

For the message push in direction to the backend the verb deliver is used. For the opposite direction
submit is used.

== WS-Security

As the communication is soap based multiple policies can be set on the connection to enforce security rules.
The module contains already 2 polices:

* backend.policy.xml (encrypts and signes messages)
* no-security.policy.xml (does just nothing - will not work with backend, because no client
identification is possible with this approach)

Some additional information about the used implementation:

=== Sending a Business Message

To send/submit a business message the following fields have to be filled:


|===
| field | mandatory | description

| messageContent/xmlContent | required | Business XML

| messageContent/document/document | should be provided | The Business Document, usually a human readable representation of the BusinessXML
It should be a PDF-A document, to always make it possible for a e-Codex receiver to have at least one document which
can be read by a human. But this depends on the UseCase. For the e-Codex container every Format which is supported by the DSS-Tools
is possible (PADES, XADES, ASIC-S).

| messageContent/document/detachedSignature | optional | If the document is not signed inline, then the detached signature takes
place here. If the document as an example origins from an asic-s container, the detached signature should be put here.

| messageAttachments/ | optional | multiple attachments to the message, the message attachments should be referenced within
the business doc or business xml

| messageAttachments/identifier | required | This is the only name of the attachment which is transported to the ecodex receiver

| messageAttachments/name | optional | will only be stored in the local connector database

| messageAttachments/mimeType | optional | will only be stored in the local connector database

| messageAttachments/name | optional | will only be stored in the local connector database

| messageDetails/backendMessageId | must be set | the message id on the backend side. It must also as the EBMS ID
a unique message id within the backend system

| messageDetails/ebmsMessageId | might be set | The EBMS ID might be set by the backend, but then it must be assured, that
the following AS4 Gateway Implementation is not changing this EBMS ID.

| messageDetails/refToMessageId | must remain empty | the refToMessageId field within e-Codex is only used by evidences
multiple business messages are grouped together by the conversationId

| messageDetails/conversationId | optional | for grouping together multiple business messages to a conversation, this
field is used. It depends on the usecase if this id might match the eg. casenumber of an case. This would be true
if within a case there is only communication with one other party.
Any value on this field has no implications on the connector

| messageDetails/originalSender | required | The specific value here depends on the use case, but it must be filled
at least with an empty string
If the message comes from an national message system, this would be the senders (technical) national address.

| messageDetails/finalRecipient | required | The specific value here depends on the use case, but it must be filled
at least with an empty string. If a national messaging system is connected here, this would be the national recipients
(technical) address

| messageDetails/service | required | The AS4 service which is used by this message

| messageDetails/service/service | most likely required | The AS4 service name which is used by this message, it can be an empty string.
Then the connector will try to lookup any matching service. This would work if only one service is configured.

| messageDetails/service/serviceType |  | The AS4 service type which is used by this message, it can be an empty string.
Most likely it is an empty string, because the connector has the full service configuration within database.
The connector will lookup the service by the name and fill out the serviceType, as long as the service name is
sufficient to identify the service

| messageDetails/action/action | required | The AS4 action which is used by this message.

| messageDetails/fromParty | required | The AS4 sending party, for details see party lookup

| messageDetails/toParty | required | The AS4 receiving party


|===


==== Party, Service lookup




The connector has the AS4 configuration in place. So if a party or service is provided with insufficient informations.
The connector will try to look it up within the configuration.
For the party this means every empty string is ignored by looking up the party within the connector configuration.
If only ONE matching party is found all other attributes are filled out by the found party. If more than one party
was found an error will occur!
For the sending application this means it is usually sufficient to only use the party name like (AT, DE, ...) because
usually in e-Codex the PartyId matches the 2-letter country code. Note that, for some use-cases countries this might
not be true.


==== Signed Document

If SIGNATURE_BASED is used the connector expects a signed PDF document. The document signature will be checked. It
is also possible to use detached signatures. So if you are using ASIC-S container within your environment you have
to put the PDF document and the detached Signature seperatly into the connector.

See the following excerpt of the xsd:

 <xs:complexType name="DomibusConnectorMessageDocumentType">
        <xs:sequence>
            <xs:element name="document" type="xs:base64Binary" xmime:expectedContentTypes="application/octet-stream"
                        minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
            <xs:element name="documentName" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
            <xs:element name="detachedSignature" type="tns:DomibusConnectorDetachedSignatureType" minOccurs="0"
                        maxOccurs="1"/>
        </xs:sequence>
    </xs:complexType>
    <xs:complexType name="DomibusConnectorDetachedSignatureType">
        <xs:sequence>
            <xs:element name="detachedSignature" type="xs:base64Binary" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
            <xs:element name="detachedSignatureName" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
            <xs:element name="mimeType" type="tns:DomibusConnectorDetachedSignatureMimeType" minOccurs="1"
                        maxOccurs="1"/>
        </xs:sequence>
 </xs:complexType>

So basically the detached signature for the PDF should be put into the detachedSignature. With this approach
ASIC-S based documents can be put into the connector.



=== Triggering an evidence message

If the application has received an ecodex message from the connector, it should respond accordingly to the
use case with an evidence message. This can be done by sending a evidence trigger to the connector. The
trigger message is missing the actual cryptographic evidence, which is actually generated by the connector.




|===
| field | mandatory | description

| messageContent | must be empty! | Business XML

| messageAttachments/ | must be empty | attachments on an evidence message are ignored!

| messageDetails/backendMessageId | must be set | the message id on the backend side. It must also as the EBMS ID
a unique message id within the backend system. If there is a national system this would be the id of the national
evidence message
For the evidence message this is a NEW message id!

| messageDetails/ebmsMessageId | might be set | The EBMS ID might be set by the backend, but then it must be assured, that
the following AS4 Gateway Implementation is not changing this EBMS ID.
For the evidence message this is a NEW message id!

| messageDetails/refToMessageId | must be set| the refToMessageId must be set to the EBMS id of the message
which should be confirmed. The backend message id works to, but only if the backend system is responding
with an message id to a new delivered message

| messageDetails/conversationId | empty | filled out by the connector, it will be taken from the original message

| messageDetails/originalSender | empty | filled out by the connector, it will be taken from the original message (finalRecipient)

| messageDetails/finalRecipient | empty | filled out by the connector, it will be taken from the original message (originalSender)

| messageDetails/service | empty | filled out by the connector, it will be taken from the original business message

| messageDetails/action/action | empty | filled out by the connector, it will be taken from configuration

| messageDetails/fromParty | required | filled out by the connector, it will be taken from the original message (toParty)

| messageDetails/toParty | required | filled out by the connector, it will be taken from the original message (fromParty)

|===

 NOTE: The "address attributes": FromParty, ToParty, OriginalSender, FinalRecipient are taken from the business message and are reverted for the to the outgoing (to the Gateway) evidence message.

After the evidence was triggered the generated evidence message will not only submitted to the other party
it will also be delivered to the backend system as a confirmation, that the trigger was successfully.


=== Receiving a confirmation message

When the backend receives a confirmation message, the refToMessageId field is filled in the following order:

* If the connector is aware of a backendMessageId of the related message, then the refToMessageId will be
set with the backendMessageId
* In all other cases the refToMessageId will be set to the EBMS_ID

This means if the backend always returns a backendMessageId for a received message, the EBMS ID will be
completly transparent for the backend. The backendMessageId is mapped by the connector to the EBMS ID.

==== Ordering of the confirmation messages

* Ordering of the confirmation messages depends on the used transporting System. The connector itself,
will always send/provide the confirmation messages in the correct order. Also the connector relies on
the ordering of the confirmation messages because the confirmation messages are chained together
and as an example a RELAY_REMMD_ACCEPTANCE can only be created if there is already a SUBMISSION_ACCEPTANCE.
